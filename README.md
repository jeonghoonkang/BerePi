## BerePi (Bere + RaspberryPi) software for IO(ITALIA) computing 
- IoT data collection and analytics software tool-kit based on RaspberryPi which is driven from IoT level computing system
- Software stack for physical computing and intelligent SW service based on IoT data collection & processing (Big data)
- is based on RaspberryPi distribution (hardware and software)
- supports Ubuntu64_ARM
  - previous version : Raspbian OS, Buster (ver 2019.09.12), with RaspBerryPi4 (input hangul mode, 한글모드)

### DiskPi which is a new direction for secure pi computing
- As of 2021, not long ago, RaspberryPi started to support SSD/HDD Booting by USB link. It gives us a new approach which has a very quick booting speed and secure, nice non-breakable booting code, rather than beaten by electricity accident such as SD card crash.

### Old documents which is still valid.

#### Wiki doc
  - RaspberryPi OS installation and setup to run the SDH sensors
  - It shows basic installation process for Raspberyypi Sensor System
    - [BerePi Wiki](https://github.com/jeonghoonkang/BerePi/wiki)
  - Installation Image for RaspberryPi4 (2020.08)
    - RaspberryPi image install (use your computer to copy raspberrypi OS in SD card)
      - https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
    - important first setup check steps:
      1. use American English language, US keyboard, US timezone (like LA)
      2. change hostname by editing /etc/hostname (like tinygw-4b-0820-31)
      3. raspberrypi config run to setup SSH connection
    - if you want to install Ubuntu 64-bit, follow the instruction, it needs 8G sd card.

#### Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using RaspberryPi 
You can connect wireless sensors to your cyber space easily, just trying to add BerePi module sensor, to your RaspberryPi.
BerePi project opens software which using BerePi hardware modules.

- If you want to setup BerePi with your own Ubuntu Linux, please run below shell script files to setup packages, development environment
  - Raspi init setting : same in the installation instruction
    - please use, wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeonghoonkang/BerePi/master/setup/init.sh
     - short URL is https://goo.gl/GDiYfN  
     - It downloads init.sh file
     - download and run : source init.sh
