systemd tends to screw up simple things

Does /var/log/motion exist?
What are the read/write permissions on /var/log/motion?
Is there a conflicting /var/log/motion/motion.log? ( 'ls -la /var/log/motion/' can provide this )

You may need to do:
 sudo mkdir /var/log/motion
 sudo chown motion /var/log/motion

And verify that the /etc/logrotate.d/motion file contains your appropriate log rotation config.
